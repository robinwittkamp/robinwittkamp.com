      with the statutory data protection regulations and this Data Protection Declaration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever you use this website, a variety of personal information will be collected. Personal
      data comprises data that can be used to personally identify you. This Data Protection
      Declaration explains which data we collect as well as the purposes we use this data for. It
      also explains how, and for which purpose the information is collected.
    </p>
    <p>
      We herewith advise you that the transmission of data via the Internet (i.e. through e-mail
      communications) may be prone to security gaps. It is not possible to completely protect data
      against third party access.

      The responsible party is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others decides
      on the purposes and means of processing personal data (names, email addresses, etc.).
    </p>
    <Heading variant="h6">Storage duration</Heading>
    <p>
      Unless a more specific storage period has been specified in this privacy policy, your personal

      you assert a justified request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your
      data will be deleted, unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your

      Information on data transfer to the USA and other non-EU countries
    </Heading>
    <p>
      Among other things, we use tools of companies domiciled in the United States or other from a
      data protection perspective non-secure non-EU countries. If these tools are active, your
      personal data may potentially be transferred to these non-EU countries and may be processed
      there. We must point out that in these countries, a data protection level that is comparable
      to that in the EU cannot be guaranteed. For instance, U.S. enterprises are under a mandate to
      release personal data to the security agencies and you as the data subject do not have any
      litigation options to defend yourself in court. Hence, it cannot be ruled out that U.S.
      agencies (e.g., the Secret Service) may process, analyze, and permanently archive your
      personal data for surveillance purposes. We have no control over these processing activities.
    </p>
    <Heading variant="h6">Revocation of your consent to the processing of your data</Heading>
    <p>
      A wide range of data processing transactions are possible only subject to your express
      consent. You can also revoke at any time any consent you have already given us. This shall be
      without prejudice to the lawfulness of any data collection that occurred prior to your
      revocation.

      THE RIGHT TO AT ANY TIME OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA BASED ON GROUNDS
      ARISING FROM YOUR UNIQUE SITUATION. THIS ALSO APPLIES TO ANY PROFILING BASED ON THESE
      PROVISIONS. TO DETERMINE THE LEGAL BASIS, ON WHICH ANY PROCESSING OF DATA IS BASED, PLEASE

    <Heading variant="h6">Right to log a complaint with the competent supervisory agency</Heading>
    <p>
      If there has been a breach of data protection legislation, the person affected may file a
      complaint with the competent regulatory authorities. The competent regulatory authority for
      matters related to data protection legislation is the data protection officer of the German
      state in which our company is headquartered. A list of data protection officers and their
      contact details can be found at the following link:{' '}

    <p>
      In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are entitled to log a complaint with a
      supervisory agency, in particular in the member state where they usually maintain their
      domicile, place of work or at the place where the alleged violation occurred. The right to log
      a complaint is in effect regardless of any other administrative or court proceedings available
      as legal recourses.

    <Heading variant="h6">Right to data portability</Heading>
    <p>
      You have the right to demand that we hand over any data we automatically process on the basis
      of your consent or in order to fulfil a contract be handed over to you or a third party in a
      commonly used, machine readable format. If you should demand the direct transfer of the data
      to another controller, this will be done only if it is technically feasible.

    <Heading variant="h6">SSL and/or TLS encryption</Heading>
    <p>
      For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as purchase
      orders or inquiries you submit to us as the website operator, this website uses either an SSL
      or a TLS encryption programme. You can recognise an encrypted connection by checking whether
      the address line of the browser switches from “http://” to “https://” and also by the
      appearance of the lock icon in the browser line.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit to us cannot be read by third
      parties.

      Information about, blockage, rectification and eradication of data
    </Heading>
    <p>
      Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the right to at any time
      demand information about your archived personal data, their source and recipients as well as
      the purpose of the processing of your data. You may also have a right to have your data
      rectified or eradicated. If you have questions about this subject matter or any other
      questions about personal data, please do not hesitate to contact us at any time.
    </p>
    <Heading variant="h6">Right to demand processing restrictions</Heading>
    <p>
      You have the right to demand the imposition of restrictions as far as the processing of your
      personal data is concerned. To do so, you may contact us at any time. The right to demand
      restriction of processing applies in the following cases:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your data archived by us, we will
        usually need some time to verify this claim. During the time that this investigation is
        ongoing, you have the right to demand that we restrict the processing of your personal data.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an unlawful manner, you have the
        option to demand the restriction of the processing of your data in lieu of demanding the
        eradication of this data.
      </li>
      <li>
        If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to exercise, defend or claim
        legal entitlements, you have the right to demand the restriction of the processing of your
        personal data instead of its eradication.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21 Sect. 1 GDPR, your rights and our rights
        will have to be weighed against each other. As long as it has not been determined whose
        interests prevail, you have the right to demand a restriction of the processing of your
        personal data.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data - with the exception
      of their archiving - may be processed only subject to your consent or to claim, exercise or
      defend legal entitlements or to protect the rights of other natural persons or legal entities
      or for important public interest reasons cited by the European Union or a member state of the
      EU.

      duration of a session (session cookies) or they are permanently archived on your device
      (permanent cookies). Session cookies are automatically deleted once you terminate your visit.
      Permanent cookies remain archived on your device until you actively delete them, or they are
      automatically eradicated by your web browser.

    <p>
      In some cases, it is possible that third-party cookies are stored on your device once you
      enter our site (third-party cookies). These cookies enable you or us to take advantage of
      certain services offered by the third party (e.g., cookies for the processing of payment
      services).
    </p>
    <p>
      Cookies have a variety of functions. Many cookies are technically essential since certain
      website functions would not work in the absence of the cookies (e.g., the shopping cart
      function or the display of videos). The purpose of other cookies may be the analysis of user
      patterns or the display of promotional messages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cookies, which are required for the performance of electronic communication transactions
      (required cookies) or for the provision of certain functions you want to use (functional
      cookies, e.g., for the shopping cart function) or those that are necessary for the
      optimization of the website (e.g., cookies that provide measurable insights into the web
      audience), shall be stored on the basis of Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR, unless a different
      legal basis is cited. The operator of the website has a legitimate interest in the storage of
      cookies to ensure the technically error free and optimized provision of the operator`s
      services. If your consent to the storage of the cookies has been requested, the respective
      cookies are stored exclusively on the basis of the consent obtained (Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. a
      GDPR); this consent may be revoked at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have the option to set up your browser in such a manner that you will be notified any time
      cookies are placed and to permit the acceptance of cookies only in specific cases. You may
      also exclude the acceptance of cookies in certain cases or in general or activate the delete
      function for the automatic eradication of cookies when the browser closes. If cookies are
      deactivated, the functions of this website may be limited.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the event that third-party cookies are used or if cookies are used for analytical purposes,
      we will separately notify you in conjunction with this Data Protection Policy and, if
      applicable, ask for your consent.

    <Heading variant="h6">Contact form</Heading>
    <p>
      If you submit inquiries to us via our contact form, the information provided in the contact
      form as well as any contact information provided therein will be stored by us in order to
      handle your inquiry and in the event that we have further questions. We will not share this
      information without your consent.
    </p>

      The processing of these data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR, if your request is

      measures. In all other cases the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the

    </p>
    <p>
      The processing of these data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR, if your request is
      related to the execution of a contract or if it is necessary to carry out pre-contractual
      measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on your consent (Article 6 (1) a GDPR)
      and/or on our legitimate interests (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR), since we have a legitimate
      interest in the effective processing of requests addressed to us.
